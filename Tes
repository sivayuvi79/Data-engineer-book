Subject: Laptop Handover Request - Last Working Day at FIS

Dear [Tech and Facilities Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request permission to hand over my company-issued laptop as my last working day with FIS is approaching. As I will be joining another organization in Bangalore, it is crucial that I complete the laptop handover process before my departure.

Summary:

My last working day with FIS is next Sunday.
I need to hand over my laptop to the tech team.
If possible, I would prefer to arrange the handover on Friday, rather than Monday.
Considering the urgency of the situation, I kindly request your assistance in scheduling the laptop handover at your earliest convenience. I understand that Fridays are typically busy for the tech team, but I believe it would greatly benefit both parties if the handover could be completed before the start of the following week.

Please let me know if it is feasible to arrange the handover on Friday. If not, I am open to alternative suggestions that would allow me to return the laptop on time. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will cooperate fully to facilitate the process.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and I am grateful for your understanding during this transition period. Should you require any further information or if there are any specific procedures I need to follow, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
